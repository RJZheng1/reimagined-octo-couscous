		          A shell script is a file interpreted and run by a Unix shell. The shell we will be using is bash, or Bourne Again shell.<br>
		          Bash is compatible with sh scripts and as such, can run sh built-in commands in addition to bash built-in commands.<br>
		          A list of sh built-in commands can be found <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#Bourne-Shell-Builtins">here</a><br>
		          A list of bash built-in commands can be found <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Bash-Builtins.html">here</a><br>
		          The advantages of using bash are many and can be read about <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_01_02.html">here</a><br>

		          Back when computers were large, software was always customized to serve a specifc purpose, and software for one given system didn't run<br>
		          on another system, making it difficult for both the users and the administrators.<br><br>
		      
		          In 1969 a team of developers in the Bell Labs laboratories started working on a solution problem to address these issues.<br>
		          -->Developed a new operation system that was:<br>
		          (1)Simple and Elegant     (2) Written in C    (3) Able to recycle code

		          Aka the "Bourne-Shell" one of the original shells developed by Stephen Bourne at AT&T's Bell Labs in 1977<br>

		          Enhancements on the sh, aka the "Bourne-again Shell" based on sh<br>
		          Can run sh shell scripts unchanged. Command completion and command history (new additions from sh)
		          
		          <font color="blue"><h2>csh and tsch</h2></font>
		          csh developed by Bill Joy<br>
		          Ken Greer developed tsch in 1978, which fixed problems in csh and added command completion (guess as you type).<br>
		          tsch does not run bash scripts
		          
                  <font color="blue"><h2>ksh</h2></font>
		          Developed by David Korn, about the time tsch was introduced.<br>
		          Improves on Bourne shell by adding floating point arithmetic, job control command aliasing and command completion.

                    <h1>Let's Get Started</h1>
                    Every bash script begins with <code>#!/bin/bash</code>.<br>
	                This is known as a shabang and notifies the Unix shell what program should be run to interpret the script.<br><br>
	                Let's start with a simple Hello World script.<br>
	                
                    <div align="left"><pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World"            #prints "Hello World\n"</code></pre></div>

                    Bash has two methods for printing things: echo and printf.<br>
                    Echo simply prints out the argument, adding a new line character.<br>
                    Printf, on the other hand, allows for definition of a formatting string, much like the printf in C.<br>
                    Comments begin with a #.<br>

                    <h1>Variables in Shell</h1>
                    To process data/information, data must be kept in the computer's RAM. RAM is divided into small locations, <br>
                    and each location had unique number called an address, which is used to hold our data. Programmers<br>
                    can give a unique name to this address called a variable.<br><br>
                    
                    <h2>Creating Variables</h2>
                    Creating a variable is simple. Just do <code>VARNAME="value"</code>.<br>
                    Variable names are case-sensitive and can contain digits, but the first character cannot be a digit.<br>
                    One thing to note is that you cannot put spaces around the equal sign.<br>
                    This is due to the way that bash interprets scripts. It breaks each line up into tokens separated by spaces and then interprets them.<br>
                    The variable value does not have to be surrounded by quotes, but it is a good idea to do so.<br>
                    There are four types of variables: integers, arrays, strings, and constants.<br>
                    You can use <code>declare -a VARIABLE</code> to make a variable an array, -i for integers, and -r for constants.<br><br>
                    
                    <h2>Arrays</h2>
                    There are a few ways to declare an array.<br>
                    <div align="left"><pre><code>ARRAY[INDEX]=VALUE
declare -a ARRAY
ARRAY=(value1 value2 ...)</code></pre></div>
                    To get the values of an array, you must use the following syntax: <code>$ARRAY[INDEX]</code>. * can be used as an index to get all the members.<br>
                    You can use unset to remove elements from an array. <code>unset ARRAY[INDEX]</code>. If no index is specified, the entire array is removed.

                    <h1>Shell Expansion</h1>
                    Single quotes are used to preserve the literal value of the characters inside. A single quote cannot be enclosed between them, even if backslash escaped.<br>
                    Double quotes also preserve the values, except for the dollar sign, back ticks, and backslash, which have special meanings.<br>
                    The backslash is used for escape sequences, listed <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_08_01.html#tab_08_01">here</a>.<br>
                    The dollar sign is used to get the value of a variable enclosed within: <code>${VAR}</code><br>
                    The backtick is used to return the output of a command: <code>`date`</code> will return the date.<br>
                    This can also be done with the dollar sign: <code>$(date)</code><br>
                    Arithmetic operations can be done on using the following syntax: <code>$[EXPRESSION]</code>. <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_03_04.html#table_03_04">List of operators</a><br>

                    <h1>Conditionals</h1>
                    <h2>If Statements</h2>
                    The general syntax for an if statement is<br>
                    <div align="left"><pre><code>if CONDITION; then
        COMMANDS
    elif CONDITION; then
        COMMANDS
    else
        COMMANDS
fi</code></pre></div>
                    A list of conditions that can be checked can be found <a href="http://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_07_01.html#tab_07_01">here</a>.<br>
                    Conditions can be simply a command. If so, then the veracity will be based on the exit status. If the exit status is 0 (presumably executed correctly), then it's true, otherwise false.<br>
                    If the condition is an arithmetic value (enclosed in double parantheses), 0 is false and other numbers are true.<br>
                    As usual, ! negates the value. -a is an and statement and -o is an or statement.<br>
                    The if-else structure can be shortened to <code>CONDITION && TRUE_COMMANDS || FALSE_COMMANDS</code><br><br>
                    
                    <h2>Case Statements</h2>
                    A case statement is used to compare a single expression to multiple values. Its syntax is as follows
                    <div align="left"><pre><code>case EXPRESSION in 
CASE1)
    COMMANDS
    ;;
CASE2)
    COMMANDS
    ;;
esac</code></pre></div>

                    <h1>Loops</h1>
                    <h2>For Loops</h2>
                    The for loop is one of the three shell looping constructs. This loop allows for specification of a list of values. <br>
                    A list of commands is executed for each value in the list. The general syntax for a for loop is as follows<br>
                    <div align="left"><pre><code>for name in LIST; do 
        COMMANDS;
done</code></pre></div>
                    
                    <h2>While Loop</h2>
                    The while loop executes until the test-command fails. Syntax is as follows<br>
                    <div align="left"><pre><code>while CONTROL-COMMAND; do
        CONSEQUENT-COMMANDS;
done</code></pre></div>
                    
                    <h2>Until Loop</h2>
                    The until loop is very similar to the while loop, except that the loop executes until the test-command executes successafully.<br>
                    It can pretty much be thought of as the opposite of the while loop. As long as the condition is false (keeps on failing), the loop will continue.<br>
                    The general syntax for an Until loop is as follows<br>
                    <div align="left"><pre><code>until TEST-COMMAND; do
        CONSQUENT-COMMANDS;
done</code></pre></div>

                  <h1>Writing a Function</h1>
        		  Shell functions are a way to group commands for later execution, using a single name for this group, or <i>routine</i>.<br>
        		  The name of the routine must be unique within the shell or script. These functions are executed like regular commands.<br>
        		  
        		  Two general syntax for creating a function is as follows<br>
        		  <div align="left"><pre><code>function FUNCTION_NAME {
    COMMANDS;
}</code></pre></div>
        		  <b>OR</b>
        		  <div align="left"><pre><code>FUNCTION_NAME () { 
    COMMANDS;
}</code></pre></div>
			  In order to get parameters, within the function body, you must use <code>${PARAMETER}</code>, where parameter is the position of the parameter, starting with 1 for the first parameter.
